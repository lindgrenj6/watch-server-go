### watch-server-go
##### (the name is literally a play on the only place I hit this with requests is...you guessed it, my watch)

Tiny little go echo application that I can hit from my fitbit via this little app: [Sendr](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/5d319520-15a0-4fa0-b84e-a877bf3d691a)

Basically just takes POST requests and does certain things on my desktop.
